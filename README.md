# Getting Started with React Google app to set the position without any API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `Site policy`

**Note: It's very helpfull to set the postion of any location. To built the feature i use
[google-map-generator.com](https://google-map-generator.com/)

There is no need to use any api just place the location through the above site and paste the html code
 . Thank you  :)
